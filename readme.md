## Phantasy Star Universe "Calculator"

Mainly just a tool for calculating runs. Separate web app from the game.



### Dude... why?

Because I'm into PSU and I want to practice using React? Everything I do for fun has to be related to the current thing I'm obsessed with. PSU is just the next victim to my habits.



### Functionality

(Hopefully...)

* Calculate runs required to \[kill X amount of enemies/ have a theoretical 100% chance at getting X item/ get X amount of EXP/ how many runs to get X amount of boxes (for daily quest in Clem)]
* Calculate how many \[enemies/ boxes/ EXP/ loot tables possible] when running X amount of this mission, Y amount of this mission... as many as you wish.

Ideally, you can run the first one and decide which missions look better to you, then run the second one and see how you can vary your runs (mix and match missions, etc).



Other stuff I want this thing to do:

* Calculate EXP required to get to a desired level from where you are currently. Can either enter a level only (not precise) or enter the game and type in both the level and the amount of EXP left (precise)
* Have multiple "windows" of the calculator open. Essentially a list of "add component" and adding a component will add a calculator window. Would make it easy to have both (all) of those calculators open and plan a session
